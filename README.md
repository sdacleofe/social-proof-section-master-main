## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sass

### What I learned

Have gained greater proficiency in experimenting with semantic elements, CSS positioning like relative and absolute, employing CSS width and max-width, and utilizing Flexbox properties. I also suggest considering the use of Sass, as it proves to be much more efficient compared to traditional CSS.
